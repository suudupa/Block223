# Group project for ECSE 223 - Model-based Programming

The Block223 application is a comprehensive implementation of the popular BrickBreaker game using Java. As a team, we devised and implemented a domain model (using UML) to allow for the creation and playability of levels, and developed the application using MVC principles.
